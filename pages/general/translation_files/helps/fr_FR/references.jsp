<br><br>The references system is a peer review 
system. If enabled by the administrator, members can assign a reference to 
other members. The reference consists of a score on a pre-defined value 
scale, and a personal comment. 
<br><br>
<span class="member">
<i>Where to find it.</i><br> 
To access the references given to you and given by you, 
go to (Menu: Personal > References). <br>
To access the references given to and by 
another member, go to a members' <a href="${pagePrefix}profiles"><u>profile</u></a> and click 
&quot;View & give references&quot;.<br>
To assign or update a reference to a 
member, you also go to that member's profile and click 
&quot;View & give references&quot;.
</span>

<span class="broker">
As a broker, you can go to your member's references via the member's <a href="${pagePrefix}profiles"><u>
profile</u></a>, &quot;Broker actions for member > manage references&quot;. 
</span>

<span class="admin"> <i>Where to find it.</i><br>
As an admin, you can view a members references via the member's <a
	href="${pagePrefix}profiles"><u> profile</u></a>, &quot;Member info > manage
references&quot;. Note that you can change an existing reference the member has
given, but you cannot give a new reference to another member for this member.
<br><br><i>How to get it working.</i><br>
You can enable the references in the <a
	href="${pagePrefix}groups#manage_group_permissions_member"><u>member
permissions</u></a> section (in block &quot;References&quot;).<br>
It is also possible to enable <a href="${pagePrefix}alerts_logs#member_alerts"><u>member
alerts</u></a> on references tresholds. These can be set in the <a
	href="${pagePrefix}settings#alerts"><u>Alerts settings</u></a>
