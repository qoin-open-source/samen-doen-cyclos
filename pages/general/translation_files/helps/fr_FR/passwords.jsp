<h3>Change login password</h3>
To change the password, fill out your current password and the new password
twice and click &quot;Submit&quot;. It is possible that password policies like
forbidding easy or obvious passwords have been activated. In such a case an
error message will appear when you chose a password that does not meet the
requirements defined in the policy. The message will inform you about the policy
and the allowed format of the password.
<br>
It is not allowed to chose a new password that you have used in the passed.

<span class="admin">If &quot;Force change on next login&quot; is checked the
member will be asked to change the password on the first login.<br>
If the group setting &quot;Send password by e-mail&quot; is enabled you will
have the extra option to automatically generate a new password and send it to
the member by clicking the submit button &quot;Reset password & send by
e-mail&quot;. In this case the password will be automatically generated, 
so you need not to fill in anything.</span>

<h2>Transaction password</h2>
A transaction password is a password that can be asked 
every time a user wants to make a payment.
<span class="admin">
According to the system (access) settings (&quot;Menu: Settings > access settings&quot;) 
the transaction password can be typed as number in a normal
form field or with a virtual keyboard. You can also choose the characters that will be
part of the transaction password.
<br><br>The transaction password is managed at the user management page 
(&quot;profile > access > manage passwords&quot;). This option is only available if the
transaction password has been enabled for the group (in group permissions).

<h3>Manage transaction Password</h3>
<br>When the <a href="#transaction_password"><u>transaction password</u></a> is enabled
for the group it can have four different statuses.
<ul>
	<li><b>Inactive:</b> The transaction password has never been
	used/generated.
	<li><b>Pending:</b> The transaction password is pending to be generated by
	the member/admin.
	<li><b>Active:</b> The transaction password has been retrieved by the
	member.
	<li><b>Blocked:</b> The transaction password has been blocked by an
	administrator.
</ul>
This status is shown in this window. <br><br>
An administrator (with the appropriate permissions) can reset or block the transaction
password by clicking the button &quot;block transaction password&quot;. 
In this case the transaction password is
invalidated and the member will not receive a new one (until an admin resets
it).<br><br>
You can also reset the transaction password via the button &quot;reset transaction
password&quot;. In this case the member will receive a new
transaction password.

<h3>Change / Unblock PIN</h3>
A <a href="#pin"><u>pin</u></a> is used for some types of external payments like POS (point of sale), paypal
or SMS payments.<br>
A PIN can only be numeric (no letters allowed). To change your PIN you have to
type your login password first. In case the
<a href="#transaction_password"><u>transaction password</u></a>
is used you have to enter that first (in stead of the login password). The pin
must be entered twice and confirmed with the &quot;Submit&quot; button.<br><br>
When the PIN is entered wrongly it can be blocked after an amount of attempts (by default 3).
You can either wait until the blocking time has been expired or &quot;un-block&quot; the PIN
manually selecting the un-block button below the change PIN window.
