<br><br>Loans can provide the basic credit mechanism for
Cyclos. Cyclos supports the essential qualities of a loan including scheduled
payments (installments) and interest, and allows administrators to apply a
variety of fees.

<span class="admin">
<br><br><i>Where to find it / how to get it working.</i><br>
For using loans in cyclos, you should perform the following steps:
<ol>
	<li><b>Make transfer types:</b> Before being able to use loans, the
	appropriate <a href="${pagePrefix}account_management#transaction_types"><u>transaction
	types</u></a> for loans must be created, as each loan must have its own transaction
	type.<br>
	In general, you will have to create two loan transaction types: one providing
	the loan to the member (coming from a system account), and another type which
	the member will use to pay back the loan (so, a member to system account). You
	cannot create the first without specifying the latter, so its best to start
	with the payback transaction type (the one from member to system). For more
	complicated debit systems, you may have to create transaction types for fees or
	interests too.
	<br><br>A new transaction type for <b>paying back the loans</b> is created as
	follows:
	<ul>
		<li>Go to the transaction section, &quot;Menu: Accounts > Account
		management&quot;.
		<li>Choose an account type on which the members will receive the loans.
		Normally, this would be the &quot;member account&quot;. Click the <img
			border="0" src="${images}/edit.gif" width="16" height="16">&nbsp; edit
		icon of this account type.
		<li>In the next window, go to the &quot;<a
			href="${pagePrefix}account_management#transaction_type_search"><u>
		transaction types</u></a>&quot; window, and click the &quot;insert new transaction
		type&quot; button below it. But before you do so, you should check if there is
		already an appropriate transaction type for loan repayments available.
		<li>In the following window, you should choose an account type in the
		&quot;To&quot; drop down box. This would normally be the &quot;debit
		account&quot;, but you'd have to think about which system account types you
		will use for loans.<br>
		Simply fill in the rest of the fields, and if necessary refer to the local
		help system.
	</ul>
	<br>
	When this is done, you can create the new transaction type for <b>granting
	the loan</b>:
	<ul>
		<li>Again, go to the transaction section, &quot;Menu: Accounts > Account
		management&quot;.
		<li>Choose the account type which you specified before in the
		&quot;to&quot; drop down box (see above), which is usually the &quot;debit
		account&quot;; Click the <img border="0" src="${images}/edit.gif" width="16"
			height="16">&nbsp; edit icon of this account type.
		<li>Check if there is an appropriate transaction type for granting loans
		available yet. If not, create one by clicking the &quot;insert new transaction
		type&quot; button.
		<li>In the following window, you should choose an account type in the
		&quot;To&quot; drop down box. This would normally be the &quot;member
		account&quot; you have used before when creating the repayment transaction
		type. By choosing a transfer type, the &quot;is loan&quot; checkbox at the
		bottom of this window will become visible. Check this checkbox, and several
		other fields will become visible. <a href="#make_loan_type"><u>Click
		here</u></a> for more details, or refer to the local help.
	</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li><b>Set appropriate permissions:</b> Make sure the appropriate <a
		href="${pagePrefix}groups#manage_groups"><u>permissions</u></a> for loans are
	set. Admins and probably brokers must <a
		href="${pagePrefix}groups#manage_group_permissions_admin_member"><u>have
	permissions</u></a> to grant loans; you may also want to set the <a
		href="${pagePrefix}groups#manage_group_permissions_member"><u>member
	permissions</u></a> to view and repay loans (and more). Note that the permission to
	repay a loan (by admin or member) must be set explicitly.<br>
	Also, you may want to set permissions for <a href="${pagePrefix}loan_groups"><u>
	loan groups</u></a>, if you want to use these.<br>
	<br>
	<li><b>Grant the loan:</b> A loan is granted by going to a member's <a
		href="${pagePrefix}profiles"><u>profile</u></a> and clicking &quot;Grant
	Loan&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	<li><b>Managing loans:</b> Loans can be managed by going to the
	&quot;Menu: Accounts > Manage Loans&quot; section. Payments can be managed via
	the &quot;Menu: Accounts > Loan Payments&quot;.
</ol>
</span>
<span class="member">
<br><br><i>Where to find it.</i><br>
You can access your loans via the main &quot;Menu:
Account > Loans&quot;. Here you can get an overview, and it is the starting
point for repayments.
</span>
<span class="broker">You can access loans of your members via the <a

<h3>Create a loan transaction type</h3>
(<i>Tip: there may be quite some linking to other sections of the help. Use
the backspace button to move back, when your browser doesn't display the back
button)</i>
<br><br>If you checked the &quot;is loan&quot; checkbox it means that the <a
	href="${pagePrefix}account_management#transaction_types"><u>transaction
type</u></a> you are creating is a <a href="#top"><u>loan</u></a> . The loan settings
will appear below as soon as you check this checkbox. <br>
In case of a loan then some other fields will have to be specified too. The most
important of those fields is the first one, the &quot;loan type&quot; field.
First make your choice for this type; the choice determines what other fields
will be visible. <br>
The actual transaction type you are editing or creating just now, is the
transaction type for putting the units on a member's account as a loan. Of
course, a corresponding transaction type for paying back these amounts is
needed; this corresponding transaction type needs to be specified at the field
&quot;repayment transaction type&quot; This will be a member-to-system account
transaction type. If it does not exist yet, you will have to create it first -
this means that you will have to create a repayment type first before you can
continue with creating the present loan transaction type.
<br><br>There are three different <a href="#loan_types"><u>loan types</u></a>
available; the rest of the visible fields will be discussed under each loan
type:
<ul>
	<li><b>Simple loan:</b> must be paid back at (or before) a specific date.
	If your loan is of this type, you must specify the following other fields:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Repayment transaction type: </b> for explanation see a bit above.
		
		<li><b>Days to repay loan:</b> This is the expiration period; after this
		period the loan will show up as &quot;expired&quot; in the loan overview of
		the member and the manage loan function in the administration section. The
		member is supposed to have paid back the loan before it is expired.
	</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li><b>Multiple payments:</b> loans of this type are divided in periodic
	(monthly) repayments, each having its own expiration date. You will have to
	specify the repayment type.
	<li><b>With fees:</b> This is a loan that can have different types of fees
	and periodic repayments. The following fees can be configured:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Monthly interest rate:</b> This is (compound) interest calculated
		per month. The total amount of the loan and other costs (interest, grant fee)
		are spread over a fixed number of periodic equal-sized payments (installment
		loan).
		<li><b>Grant fee: </b> This is the one time fee that needs to be paid for
		the loan. This amount is spread over (included in) all periodic repayments.
		The fee can be a percentage of the total loan amount or a fixed amount.
		<li><b>Expiry fee:</b> This is the fixed amount that has to be paid when
		a repayment has not been done in time (before the expiration date).
		<li><b>Expiry interest: </b> This is the interest charged every day when
		a repayment has not be done in time.
	</ul>
</ul>
<hr class="help">
</span>

<a name="loan_types"></a>
<h3>Loan types</h3>
<br><br>There are three different <a href="#top"><u>loan</u></a> types available:

<ul>
	<li><b>Simple loan:</b> This means that the loan will have to be paid back
	at a specific date. At this date the loan will expire. Within this period the
	member can chose to pay the full amount at once or pay part of the amount in
	several payments. The only thing which counts is that all has to be paid back
	before the expiration date.
	<li><b>Multiple payments:</b><br>
	With this loan type the repayment is divided in periodic (monthly) repayments.
	When granting the loan to the member you can specify the first loan repayment
	date and the number of loan <a href="#component"><u>components</u></a>. Every
	loan installment will have its own (monthly) expiration date. When the
	installment expires it will show up as &quot;expired&quot; in the loan
	installments overview of the member and in the manage loan function in the
	administration section.
	<li><b>With fees:</b> This is a loan that can have different types of fees
	and periodic repayments. Every fee can have it's own repayment type. It is just
	as the previous loan type, but with extra possible fees.
</ul>

<h3>Grant loan</h3>
With this function you can give <a href="#top"><u>loans</u></a> to a Member. To
be able to give a loan certain conditions must be met first, <a href="#top"><u>click
here</u></a> to see which.
<br><br>The following fields need to be filled in to grant the loan:
<ul>
	<li><b>Loan group:</b> This option will display if the member is the
	responsible member or part of one of more <a href="${pagePrefix}loan_groups"><u>loan
	groups</u></a>. If you don't want to get any loan group involved, but in stead want to
	pass the loan to the member in personal, select the &quot;Personal&quot;
	option. <br>
	<li><b>Identifier:</b> This is the name by which the loan will be
	identified. You may choose anything you like.<br>
	Note: The identifier field is a <a href="${pagePrefix}custom_fields"><u>custom
	loan field</u></a> provided with the default database. You can remove it or create
	other loan custom fields with differerent rules. <br>
	<li><b>Loan type:</b> This is the most important field in the form. Here
	you select which transaction type the loan belongs to. Each of these
	transaction types implies one of the three possible <a href="#loan_types"><u>loan
	types</u></a>. Depending on the implied loan type, the rest of the form will show its
	fields. We will cover the <b>loan type specific fields</b> below.<br>
	<li><b>Description:</b> enter a description for the loan.<br>
	<li><b>Amount:</b> This is the total amount which the member gets on his
	account. It is the initial debt amount, or &quot;Principal&quot; of the loan.<br>
	<li><b>Grant in past:</b> Check this checkbox if the date for this loan
	should <b>NOT</b> be today, but a date in the past in stead. If you check this
	box, you will be asked to specify that date in an extra field which will show
	up.<br>
	<li><i>loan type specific fields:</i> The rest of the fields in the form
	is dependant on what you chose at the &quot;loan type&quot; drop down.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Simple Loan:</b> If the loan transaction type you chose implies a
		&quot;Simple Loan&quot; type, the following fields are visible:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Repayment Date:</b> The date that the loan will need to be repaid
			(&quot;remittance&quot;). At this date an alert will be generated and the
			loan status will change to &quot;expired&quot; (in the loan administration
			section).
		</ul>
		<br>
		<br>
		<li><b>Multiple Payments Loan:</b> If the loan transaction type you chose
		implies a &quot;Multiple repayments loan&quot; type, the following fields are
		visible:
		<ul>
			<li><b>First expiry date:</b> The loan repayment is split up in several
			&quot;loan <a href="#component"><u>components</u></a>&quot;. Here you enter
			the date that the first loan component will need to be repaid (so <b>not</b>
			the entire loan). On this date an alert will be generated and the loan
			component status will change to &quot;expired&quot;.
			<li><b>Number of repayments:</b> The number of monthly repayments (loan
			components).
			<li><b>Calculate:</b> The calculate button will show the different loan
			repayments and their expiration date. Those dates and values can be changed.
			If you change the values make sure that that the total amount of the
			components will be the same as the total loan amount.
		</ul>
		<br>
		<li><b>Loan with Fees:</b> If the loan transaction type you chose implies
		a &quot;Loan with Fees&quot; type, the following fields are visible:
		<ul>
			<li><b>All interest and fees settings:</b> These fields above the
			&quot;description&quot; field indicate the fees which are due. They are just
			for information and cannot be changed. For more information <a
				href="#make_loan_type"> <u>click here</u></a>.
			<li><b>First expiry date:</b> The loan repayment is split up in several
			&quot;loan <a href="#component"><u>components</u></a>&quot;. Here you enter
			the date that the first loan component will need to be repaid (so <b>not</b>
			the entire loan). On this date an alert will be generated and the loan
			component status will change to &quot;expired&quot;.
			<li><b>Number of repayments:</b> The number of monthly repayments
			(components).
			<li><b>Show:</b> This button will show the different loan components and
			their expiration date. Those dates and values can't be changed directly, you
			can only change them by modifying the total amount or the number of
			repayments. The amounts shown have the various fees included.
		</ul>

<hr class='help'>

<a name="status"></a>
<b>Loan status</b><br>   
The loan status can apply for loans or loan <a href="#component"><u>components</u></a>.
It can be one of the following:
<ul>
	<li><b>Open:</b> The loan is open what means it has not been repaid but
	did not reach the expire date. There are still payment obligations for the
	member.
	<li><b>Expired:</b> The loan repayment date has been passed but it hasn't
	been paid back
	<li><b>Closed / repaid:</b> The loan has been repaid or discarded and is
	administratively closed. The member doesn't have payment obligations anymore.
	<li><b>Discarded</b> A loan component is normally discarded if the loan
	has been paid by other means, for example goods or conventional money. A
	discarded loan component can be considered as closed.<br>
	<li><b>In process:</b> When a loan reaches the expire date an
	administrator can change the status to &quot;in process&quot;. Mostly because
	of the re-negotiating of the loan. After this status an administrator can
	either put the loan in the &quot;recoverd&quot; or &quot;unrecoverable&quot;
	status (see next) This status can only be reached from an expired loan. It
	means that the loan is expired, but that the parties are negotiating on what to
	do with it. <br>
	<li><b>Recovered:</b> This is an &quot;end&quot;status after a &quot;in
	process&quot; status. It means that the loan has been recovered.
	<li><b>Unrecoverable:</b> This status can only be reached from the
	&quot;in process&quot; status. Strictly seen, it means that this loan is still
	due, but all parties consider it as not payable by the member, and don't expect
	any payment anymore. The loan is in sort of a &quot;frozen&quot; state.
	<li><b>Pending authorization:</b> The payment of the loan needs to
	authorized. Once the loan payment is autorized the transfer will be done
	automatically.
	<li><b>Autorization denied:</b> The payment of the loan has been denied.
	This means the loan is administratively canceled.
