<span class="admin"> <i>How to get it working.</i><br>
You can enable the ads interests in the <a

permissions</u></a> section in the block &quot;preferences&quot;.<br>

having direct access to this functionality. </span>

<h3>New ad interest</h3>
<br><br>Here you can define an ad interest, for which you will receive
notifications.<br>
Start with giving the entry a meaningful name. Now you can define criteria which
must be met. If a member places an advertisement which meets all of the criteria
you entered, you will receive a notification. You can define the following:
<ul>
	<li>Whether you are looking for offers or requests
	<li>The category the ad must be in
	<li>The member login name by whom the ad must be submitted
	<li>The member name by whom the ad must be submitted
	<li>The price range the ad must be in
	<li>One or more keywords the ad text or title must match (but must be in the exact sequence)
</ul>
You are advised not be too restrictive. A common usage case is to only enter a
keyword to receive notifications of certain new ads. But you could use this
function in many ways, limited only by your creativity.
<br><br>Click the &quot;submit&quot; button when you are done.
