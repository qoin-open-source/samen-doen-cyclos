<br><br>Loan Groups allow members to be collectively
responsible for a loan.<br>
Giving a loan to a loan group means that the responsible member for the loan
group will receive the loan. All members can view the loan and also repay the
loan.
<i>Where to find it.</i>
<br>
Loan groups can be accessed via
<span class="admin"> &quot;Menu: Users & Groups: Loan groups&quot;. <br>
To view this item the administrator needs to have the correct <a
	href="${pagePrefix}groups#manage_group_permissions_admin_member"><u> permissions</u></a>
(block loan groups) <br><br>

<i>How to get it working.</i><br>
Once you created a loan group you can add members to it as described in below in
<a href="#create_loan_group"><u>create loan group</u></a> &quot;<br>
In order to give a loan to a loan group a loan must exists and the admin must
have the <a href="${pagePrefix}groups#manage_group_permissions_admin_member"><u>
permission</u></a> to give the loan (in permissions block &quot;loans&quot;)<br>
There are additional <a href="${pagePrefix}groups#edit_member_group"><u>
loan groups settings</u></a> that can be defined per member group.<br>
You can either give a loan via &quot;Menu: Users & Groups: Loan groups&quot; >
edit loan group > Give loan or via the <a
	href="${pagePrefix}profiles#actions_for_member_by_admin"><u> </u></a> (block Loans > Grant
loan) </span>
