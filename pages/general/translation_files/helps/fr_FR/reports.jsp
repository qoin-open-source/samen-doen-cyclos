Reports allow you to get an overview of the state of the system. You can view
several kinds of reports:
<ul>
	<li><b>individual activity reports of one member</b>
	<li><b>tables with individual scores for a set of members</b>
	<li><b>system wide scores</b>
</ul>
The reports score the number of transactions, the trade volume, the number 
of ads and the number of references set out.

In contrast to reports, Cyclos also offers <a href="${pagePrefix}statistics"><u>
statistics</u></a>, which are extended reports with statistical analysis.
<br><br>
<i>Where to find it?</i><br>
You can reach reports in the following ways:
<span class="admin">
There is a main menu item on reports: &quot;Menu: Reports&quot;. It contains various
sub-items.
</span>
Individual reports of members can be viewed via a member's <a href="${pagePrefix}profiles"><u>
profile</u></a>.
<span class="admin">
<br><br><i>How to get it working?</i><br>
All the report types have a <a href="${pagePrefix}groups#manage_group_permissions_admin_system"><u>
permission</u></a> which must be enabled before they will be visible. The
permissions can be found in a block entitled &quot;Reports&quot;.
</span><hr>

<h2>Member lists</h2>
This function lets you view a list with members containing various data on each
member. You may request the data about the present state, or you may choose a
point in history.<br>
You may request data on the following subjects:
<ul>
	<li>member and broker name
	<li>ads
	<li>references
	<li>account limits and balances.
</ul>

Note that this is all &quot;point data&quot;, which means the data is about a
specific point in time. Consequence of this is that information on trade activity
cannot be given (as the trade on a point in time is senseless). 
If you want data over a range in time, you should go to
&quot;Menu: 
<a href="#member_reports"><u>member reports</u></a>&quot; or to &quot;Menu: <a
	href="${pagePrefix}statistics"><u>statistics</u></a>&quot;.
<br><br>If you check a lot of checkboxes, it could take a few seconds to make the
calculations. So please have patience.<br><br>
At the bottom of the page, you can <a href="#results"><u>print or download</u></a> the results.
<br><br>
The following options are available:
<ul>
	<li><b>Time:</b> first you should select a point in time on which you would
	have the list. There are two options:
	<ul>
		<li><b>current time:</b> give of course a list with present data.
		<li><b>history:</b> gives a list on a date in the past. You should
		specify the date if you choose this option. You may use the 
		date picker by clicking the calendar icon (
		<img border="0" src="${images}/calendar.gif" width="16" height="16">&nbsp;).
	</ul> <br><br>
	<li><b>Broker:</b> In this section, you can specify the name or login name of
	a <a href="${pagePrefix}brokering"><u>broker</u></a>. Then, your list with data
	will be limited to only the members of this broker.<br><br>
	<li><b>Members:</b> In this section you can specify the following:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Member name:</b> check this if you want the name of the member
		to be printed in each row of the list. If you don't check this, the member
		data will be printed anonymously.
		<li><b>broker login:</b> check this and the broker login name will be printed with
		each item in the list. 
		<li><b>broker name:</b> check this and the broker's name (real name) will be printed
		with each item in the list.
		<li><b>Permission groups:</b> Use this multi drop down to select the groups of which
		you want this list. If you select for example &quot;full members&quot;, all members
		in this group will be included (of course, depending on what you entered in the 
		&quot;broker&quot; section).
	</ul><br><br>
	<li><b>Ads:</b> In this section you specify which data you want to be included about
	<a href="${pagePrefix}advertisements"><u>advertisements</u></a>. For each checkbox, 
	the number of ads with that specific <a href="${pagePrefix}advertisements#ad_status"><u>
	status</u></a> are printed.
	<ul>
		<li><b>active ads</b>
		<li><b>expired ads</b>
		<li><b>permanent ads</b>
		<li><b>scheduled ads</b>
	</ul><br><br>
	<li><b>References:</b> In this section you can specify if you want to view information
	on &quot;given&quot; and &quot;received&quot; <a href="${pagePrefix}references"><u>references</u></a>.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Accounts:</b> In this section you can specify which account information to print:
	<ul>
		<li><b>lower credit limit</b>
		<li><b>upper credit limit</b>
		<li><b>account balance</b>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Member Reports</h2>
This function allows you to print a report with member transaction and invoice
information. 

<b>WARNING</b>: Please be aware that this function is quite heavy. It allows you
to list <b>ALL</b> transactions of <b>all</b> members. It may cause very heavy
server load, and may eventually cause the server to crash if you request too
much data.
<br><br>NOTE that you have to go through the form in the given order, from top to
bottom. The payment filter box may for example be empty if you do not first
select an account type. <br><br>
At the bottom of the page, you can <a href="#results"><u>print or download</u></a> the results.
<br><br>
On the form, you may specify the following elements:
<ul>
	<li><b>member name</b>: The login name is always shown. If you want the
	member name to show up you will have to selected it here.
	<li><b><a href="${pagePrefix}brokering"><u>broker</u></a> login and name</b>: this
	information won't show up unless you check these checkboxes.
	<li><b>Member groups</b>: here you can specify which
	<a href="${pagePrefix}groups"><u>member group(s)</u></a> you
	want to view.
	<li><b>Account type</b>: usually, a member group has one
	<a href="${pagePrefix}account_management#accounts"><u>type of account</u></a>.
	However, it is possible that members have multiple account types. Specify the
	type you want to see here.
	<li><b>from and to fields</b>: to specify the date range.
	<li><b>what to show?</b>: this is probably the most important field. Here
	you specify if you want to view transactions or invoices.<br>
	If you selected transactions:
	<ul>
		<li><b>payment filters</b> allows you to specify which kind of
		transactions you want to have listed. The
		<a href="${pagePrefix}account_management#transaction_types"><u>payment filters</u></a>
		can be specified in
		the <a href="${pagePrefix}account_management#account_search"><u>&quot;Manage
		account&quot;</u></a> section. For the payment filter to show up in the reports
		function they must be marked with the option &quot;Show in reports&quot;.
		<li><b>debit / credit transactions</b>:
		after you chose a payment filter, this will become visible. You <b>must</b>
		choose at least one of these checkboxes. A debit transaction is a payment.
		<li><b>include members without transactions:</b> if checked, includes members who did
		not trade.
		<li><b>details level</b> allows you to specify how much details you want
		to see.
		<ul>
			<li><b>summary</b> gives you only the total sum of all transactions in
			the period, resulting in one line per member.
			<li><b>summary and transactions</b> lists all transactions in the
			period, of each member, plus a header with summarizing information. This
			results in a long report with a balance and transaction overview for each
			member, which may be used as a personal account overview to send to members.
			However, calculating this does not take more time and server load than
			selecting just the summary.
		</ul>
	</ul>
	If you selected <a href="${pagePrefix}invoices"><u>invoices</u></a>, 
	the result page will show you a list of members, with
	for each member the amount of invoices, and the total sum on these invoices.
	You have the following options:
	<ul>
		<li><b>include members without invoices</b>
		<li><b>Members invoices:</b> You can specify to include incoming (a bill send to
		these members) and outgoing (bills send by these members) invoices.
		<li><b>System invoices:</b> (works the same).
	</ul>
</ul>

drop down allows you to specify if sending of the SMS was succesful or if it failed.
<br>
After clicking &quot;search&quot; the results will be displayed in a window below.
