<br><br>Messages in cyclos can be used on many different occasions
between users of all types. There are many flexible features
available for sending messages between members and between groups. It is also possible
to define different categories of messages, where certain groups can be given access
to certain categories of messages.<br>
Messages are send via an internal messaging system in cyclos. This means that
the recipient sees the message you sent as soon as he logs in. Cyclos can be <a
	href="${pagePrefix}notifications"><u>configured</u></a> that these messages
are also sent via e-mail - however, this is the responsibility of the 
receiver to allow this or not. If you want to be sure that a message is send by e-mail, 
you should use e-mail directly. This can however be done via the cyclos-interface,
which contains a &quot;send e-mail&quot; button in each member profile.
<i>Where to find it?</i><br>
<span class="member">You can access messages via the &quot;Menu: Personal
> messages&quot; </span>
<span class="admin">You can access messages via the &quot;Menu: Messages
> messages&quot;. </span>
<span class="broker">To send messages as a broker (to all your members), you'd also use
&quot;Menu: Personal > messages&quot;, but you may also use the &quot;Menu: Brokering
> message to members&quot; option.
</span>
Another way to send messages is to go to the
<a href="${pagePrefix}profiles"><u>profile</u></a>
of a member, and then click the &quot;send message&quot; button
<span class="admin">in the &quot;Member info&quot; section</span>.
<span class="admin">
<br><br><i>How to get it working?</i><br>
You will need to set the autorisaties to allow messages. For admins, you should set
<a href="${pagePrefix}groups#manage_group_autorisaties_admin_member"><u>autorisaties</u></a>
under the block &quot;Messages&quot;; this allows you to set various autorisaties for sending
messages to members.<br>
The <a href="${pagePrefix}groups#manage_group_autorisaties_member"><u>autorisaties for members</u></a>
concerning messages can be found under the block entitled &quot;Messages&quot;.<br>
Brokers have an additional set of <a href="${pagePrefix}groups#manage_group_autorisaties_broker"><u>
autorisaties</u></a> concerning sending messages to their brokered members, which can be 
found under the block &quot;personal messages&quot;.
