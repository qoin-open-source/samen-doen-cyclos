<br><br>A member can publish advertisements and search for

Advertisements have a special main menu item (called &quot;advertisements&quot;,
not surprisingly). Here you can perform searches on the advertisements

<h3>Advertisement search</h3>
The advertisement search window allows you to search advertisements throughout
the system. It has a keyword search and the option to
search either in &quot;offers&quot; (default) or &quot;wants&quot;. As with any
search window in cyclos, any search field left blank will return all possible values
for that search field. This means that if you click the &quot;search&quot;
button without specifying any keyword, all offers (or wants) available will be
returned.<br><br>The advertisement search will search in all advertisement fields (so
in Title, description, owner, category level etc). You can use more than one
keyword in the search.<br>
Various &quot;operators&quot; can be used with the member (and advertisement)
search. The most commonly used are:
<ul>
	<li><b>*</b> The asterisk &quot;wildcard&quot; allows you to search for part of
	words. For example a search on ba* will return all ads that have the letter
	combination ba in one of its fields like for example Baker, bargain, bass
	gitar.
	<li><b>- not</b> A search with a keyword preceded directly by a minus sign
	or preceded by &quot;not&quot; and a space will return results that do not
	contain that keyword.
	<li><b>or</b> The search should return results with either the word
	preceding &quot;or&quot; or the keyword behind it.
	<li><b>and</b> The search should return results with both the word
	preceding &quot;and&quot; and the keyword behind it.
</ul>
If you want more search options, you can click the &quot;Advanced&quot; 
button; then you can narrow down your search by selecting various search
options like price range, category and publishing date. The options are all
pretty straightforward and self-explanatory.
<span class='admin'>
<br>The status drop down allows you to search on the <a href="#ad_status"><u>
ad status</u></a>.
The &quot;group&quot; drop down allows you to search on a
<a href="${pagePrefix}groups#group_filters"><u>group filter</u></a>, 
whereas the &quot;permission groups&quot; drop down allows you to specify
a group directly. Of course, these two items shouldn't contradict each other.
Often, the group filter is used to specify a set of groups residing in the
same geographical community, but this of course depends on you local configuration
and the definition of you group filters.
</span>
<br><br>
In stead of searching for a keyword, you can also browse a advertisement category
via the window below titled &quot;browse by category&quot;. If this window is not visible,
you should click on the link &quot;View categories&quot; and it will be displayed.
In this window, all available categories are listed.
Behind each category name is the number of advertisements in that category;
when you click on the name all offers or all wants in that category will 
be displayed in a list.
<br><br>
Another option is to view the latest ads via the &quot;view latest ads&quot; link.
Click on it and all the ads will be displayed, sorted from new to old. 
It will show either the all offers or all wants depending on the
selection you made.

<h3>Advertisements overviews</h3>
Various windows will show you an overview of advertisements. Most
of these windows have the following elements, allowing you to do

	description. It will show up in the search result window.
	<li><b>description:</b> You can use the &quot;Description&quot; field for the
	details. For the description you may use &quot;rich text&quot; which means
	you have some extra options to get a nice layout for the advertisement.
	<li><b>not-expirable:</b> For long term offers you can check this checkbox.
	If that case the advertisement will not expire. See next item. In order
	to keep the advertisements in your organization up to date (and not full of
	items which are not available anymore), we advise to use this checkbox only
	with services, and not with goods of which you have only one item.    
	<li><b>Publication date / expiry date:</b> The &quot;Publication Date&quot; is
	the date that the advertisement will be published for the first time, 
	which means that it will show up in the search for products & services. 
	An advertisement has a maximum life time by default (set by the 
	administration). When the &quot;expiration date&quot; is reached the 
	ad will not show up anymore in the searches (but it will show up in your list).
	<li><b>external publication:</b> If you check &quot;external publication&quot;
	you allow the ad to be published automatically in the community website.
	<li><b>pictures:</b> You can upload one or more <a href="${pagePrefix}profiles#picture"><u>
	pictures</u></a> related to the advertisement. 
</ul> 
If you are changing an existing advertisement, the form will also show a
button labeled &quot;Insert new advertisment&quot; below; you can use this to create
a new advertisement.
<br><br><b>Note: </b>There is a maximum number of advertisements you can
publish. This is set by the administration. If you want to place more
advertisements, you need to first delete some older ads.

<h3>Advertisement categories</h3>
This page allows you to manage a advertisement categorie level If you are within
a category below the &quot;Main category&quot; a navigation path like &quot;Main
category > second category level > ... &quot; will show up. The page will list
all the categories above the level indicated in this navigation path. <br>
You can select the links in the navigation path to go back to a higher level of 
categories. The categories in the list show their name, status and the number of sub
categories it has. The items are shown:
<ul>
	<li><b>Title:</b> the name of the category
	<li><b>Status:</b> active (used) or inactive. Inactive categories and
	their contained sub categories and advertisements are (temporary) not used and
	thus not visible to users; the category can be reactivated however.
	<li><b>Sub category:</b> If the category level has sub categories it will
	show the number of sub categories the category level contains.
	<li><img border="0" src="${images}/edit.gif" width="16" height="16">&nbsp;
	Clicking this item will bring you inside the category where you can modify it

<h3>Edit category / new category</h3>
This is the page for editing or adding a category. It shows the parent category
and the name field (which you can change).
<br>
You can add one or more items in the category level. If you put more then one you 
will have to put each one in a new line.<br>
The status which can be active or inactive. When an category is not marked as active
it won't show up anywhere (not in the searches or combo boxes). The reason for
this is that you cannot delete categories if they (or their sub categories) contain
advertisements. The active/inactive checkbox allows you to have an opportunity to
make the category invisible, even when it contains active ads. You should, however,
be careful with this, because de-activating a category can effect a lot of users who
might start asking questions about this.<br><br>
Once the category level is created you can add items to it by selecting &quot;Insert new
category&quot; button below the list.
