<h3>System alerts</h3>
The system alerts window will show a list with system alerts. These can be
alerts related to the system the software is running on and alerts that are not
directly related to member accounts. The following alerts are available:
<ul>
	<li>Application started
	<li>Application shutdown
	<li>Account fee started
	<li>Account fee canceled
	<li>Account fee finished
	<li>Account fee failed
	<li>Account fee recovered
</ul>
You can delete alerts either with the <img border="0" src="${images}/delete.gif"
	width="16" height="16">&nbsp;Delete icon at the right of the alert or
selecting one or more alerts and click the &quot;Remove Selected&quot; button.
This will remove the alerts from the list. However, there is an <a
	href="#alerts_history"><u>Alerts History</u></a> window, where you can do a
search on old Alerts deleted from the list. This way it is possible to detect
reoccurring alerts and patterns.
