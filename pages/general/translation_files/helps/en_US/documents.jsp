<br><br>Documents are pages with information which can
show up in the Member section of Cyclos.
The member can select a document from a list.<br><br>  
There are two types of documents. &quot;Static&quot; and &quot;Dynamic
documents.<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Statics</b> documents are just files like a pdf file and can be assigned
to an individual member or a member group.</li>
	<li><b>Dynamic</b> documents are html documents
that can be assigned to one or more groups. These documents can get a personal
flaw for the member as it can retrieve fields from the profile of the member
viewing it.</li>
</ul>
<span class="admin">
A typical custom document would be a loan contract or any kind of
request document which the member can use to request something from the
administration.<br>
A Dynamic document can be shown directly when a member opens it; in contrast to that,
it is also possible to first present a form which needs to be filled in by the Member.
When the member submits the form the result document can include the input the
member entered, as well as the member profile fields.

<br><br><i>Where to find it?</i><br>
Documents can be found under the &quot;Menu: Content Management >
Documents&quot;. An example of creating a dynamic document can be found in the
cyclos wiki, under the section &quot;configuration - custom documents&quot;.
<br>
Existing individual member documents can be reached from the <a
	href="${pagePrefix}profiles"><u> profile</u></a> of a member (block
&quot;member info&quot;).

<br><br><i>How to get it working?</i><br>
Before you can create documents, you will need to set the <a href="${pagePrefix}
groups#manage_group_permissions_admin_member"><u>permissions</u></a> first. This can be done
under the block &quot;Documents&quot;, via several check boxes.
Once you have these permissions, you can create new documents via the &quot;Menu:
Content Management > Documents&quot;.
<br><br>
<b>Note 1:</b> For each created document, the visibility has to be set in the group
<a href="${pagePrefix}groups#manage_group_permissions_member"><u>permissions</u></a>, block
&quot;documents&quot;. So this means that documents are assigned to certain member groups.
It is possible to set the document only viewable by administrators, only by
administrators and brokers, and by administrators, brokers and the member self
(members can never see each others documents).<br><br>
<b>Note 2:</b> There exists no such thing as admin documents in cyclos.
